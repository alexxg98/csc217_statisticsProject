# Statistics Project

This is the final project for my Probability and Statistics for Computer Science course (CSC 21700). The project is done using Python on Jupyter Notebook.

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze one or more data sets. For my project, I chose two data sets to explore: food recalls and outbreaks in the United States. I explored how the data changed overtime and analyzed if there was a causation relationship between the two variables.
